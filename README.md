This website is regarding importance of renewable energy such as solar energy which is related to one of the 17 SDGs(SDG 6 - Affordable And Clean Energy). I've made this website along with my team for a Hackathon called Uncease 2023 conducted by a startup called Newbie Learning.


Main Highlights of the website:

-Parallax effect on the homepage

-A cool layout of the navigation menu

-Solar Energy cost calculator

-An interactive game related to Renewable and Non Renewable Energy sources

-A working model of a chatbot in the "Get Help" section, which consists of various predefined commands
Try asking 

1. "where can i get solar panels"

2.  "what are the government schemes"

3.  "what can i do for you"

4.  "members of your organisation"

5.  "ok"

6.  "bye"
